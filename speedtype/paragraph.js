    "If you're a lover, you should know The lonely moments just get lonelier The longer you're in love than if you were alone Memories turn into daydreams, become a taboo I don't want to be afraid The deeper that I go It takes my breath away Soft hearts, electric souls Heart to heart and eyes to eyes Is this taboo? Baby, we built this house on memories Take my picture now, shake it 'til you see it And when your fantasies become your legacy Promise me a place in your house of memories",
    "I think of you from time to time More than I thought I would You were just too kind and I was too young to know That's all that really matters I was a fool Baby, we built this house on memories Take my picture now, shake it 'til you see it And when your fantasies become your legacy Promise me a place in your house of memories",
    "Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily You found a new girl, and it only took a couple weeks Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world? (World?) And good for you, I guess that you've been working on yourself I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl (girl) Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy Not me, if you ever cared to ask Good for you, you're doing great out there without me, baby God, I wish that I could do that I've lost my mind, I've spent the night crying on the floor of my bathroom But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it But I guess good for you",
    "I would be complex I would be cool They'd say I played the Ô¨Åeld before I found someone to commit to And that would be ok For me to do Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you I'd be a fearless leader I'd be an alpha type When everyone believes ya What's that like? I'm so sick of running as fast as I can Wondering if I'd get there quicker If I was a man And I'm so sick of them coming at me again They would say I hustled Put in the work They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve What I was wearing If I was rude Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves",
    "You have my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star Baby, 'cause in the dark You can't see shiny cars And that's when you need me there With you I'll always share Because When the sun shines, we'll shine together Told you I'll be here forever Said I'll always be your friend Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end Now that it's raining more than ever Know that we'll still have each other You can stand under my umbrella These fancy things will never come in between You're part of my entity, here for infinity When the world has took its part When the world has dealt its cards If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart Because When the sun shines, we shine together Told you I'll be here forever Said I'll always be your friend Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end",
    "I kinda wanna throw my phone across the room 'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true With paper-white teeth and perfect bodies Wish I didn't care I know that beauty is not my lack But it feels like that weight is on my back And I can't let it go Co-comparison is killin' me slowly I think, I think too much 'Bout kids who don't know me I'm so sick of myself I'd rather be, rather be Anyone, anyone else But jealousy, jealousy And I see everyone gettin' all the things I want And I'm happy for them, but then again, I'm not Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos I can't stand it, oh, God, I sound crazy",
    "Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landside, No escape from reality Open your eyes, Look up to the skies and see, I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, Because I'm easy come, easy go, Little high, little low, Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to Me, to me Mamaaa, Just killed a man, Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, Now he's dead Mamaaa, life had just begun, But now I've gone and thrown it all away Mama, oooh, Didn't mean to make you cry, If I'm not back again this time tomorrow, Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters Too late, my time has come, Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all The time Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go, Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth Mama, oooh I don't want to die, I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all. I see a little silhouetto of a man, Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango! Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me",
    "Waktu kau lewat aku sedang mainkan gitar Sebuah lagu yang kunyanyikan tentang dirimu Seperti kemarin kamu hanya lemparkan senyum Lalu pergi begitu saja bagai pesawat tempur Hei kau yang manis singgahlah dan ikut bernyanyi Sebentar saja nona sebentar saja hanya sebentar Rayuan mautku tak membuat kau jadi galak Bagai seorang diplomat ulung engkau mengelak Kalau saja aku bukanlah penganggur Sudah kupacari kau Jangan bilang tidak bilang saja iya Iya lebih baik daripada kau menangis Penguasa penguasa Berilah hambamu uang",
    "Kisah usang tikus-tikus kantor Yang suka berenang di sungai yang kotor Kisah usang tikus-tikus berdasi Yang suka ingkar janji lalu sembunyi Di balik meja teman sekerja Di dalam lemari dari baja Kucing datang cepat ganti muka Segera menjelma bagai tak tercela Masa bodoh hilang harga diri Asal tak terbukti ah tentu sikat lagi Tikus-tikus tak kenal kenyang Rakus, rakus, bukan kepalang Otak tikus memang bukan otak udang Kucing datang tikus menghilang Kucing-kucing yang kerjanya molor Tak ingat tikus kantor datang menteror Cerdik, licik, tikus bertingkah tengik Mungkin karena sang kucing pura-pura mendelik",
    "Untukmu yang duduk sambil diskusi Untukmu yang biasa bersafari Di sana di gedung DPR Wakil rakyat kumpulan orang hebat Bukan kumpulan teman-teman dekat Apalagi sanak famili Di hati dan lidahmu kami berharap Suara kami tolong dengar lalu sampaikan Jangan ragu jangan takut karang menghadang Bicaralah yang lantang jangan hanya diam Di kantong safarimu kami titipkan Masa depan kami dan negeri ini Dari Sabang sampai Merauke Saudara dipilih bukan dilotre Meski kami tak kenal siapa saudara Kami tak sudi memilih para juara",
    "We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I (do I) A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (say it) Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on) We know the game and we're gonna play it And if you ask me how I'm feeling"
